Updated at.


Our task is to analyze the data and create a dashboard that answers the questions:

The number of our total pool 

Distribution of pool per job function 

Distribution of pool per location 

The pool that was added the last week (22 â€“ 26 July)

A list of candidates added to the pool today (29 of July)

The completed dashboard is built using Python(Sample_Candidates_Pool.ipynb).
